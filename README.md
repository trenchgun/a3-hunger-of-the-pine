#Hunger of the Pine

This is a a large scale, multi team player vs player mission. BLUFOR must find and extract their CIA source and obtain as much intel as possible,
while OPFOR must locate their research personell and secure their research data. Teams are in competetion but heavily discouraged from engaging
each other in combat. Its a very dark, very spooky, and slow paced horror mission made for Halloween.

Thanks to ALiAS for his spooky monster scripts that helped as set pieces and supernatural enemies in the mission. This mission uses Superxpdude's
XPT mission framework. My work is found in the functions and init files as well as the mission.sqm. Any code taken from another source is credited.
